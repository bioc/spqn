Package: spqn
Title: Spatial quantile normalization
Version: 0.99.3
Description: The spqn package implements spatial quantile normalization (SpQN). This method was
	     developed to remove a mean-correlation relationship in correlation matrices built from
	     gene expression data. It can serve as pre-processing step prior to a co-expression
	     analysis.
